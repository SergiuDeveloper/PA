Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes: Resident, Hospital, Main.
Create all the objects in the example (one by one or using streams).
Create a list of residents, using an ArrayList implementation. Sort the residents, using a comparator.
Create a set of hospitals, using a TreeSet implementation. Make sure that Hospital objects are comparable.
Create two maps (having different implementations) describing the residents and the hospital preferences and print them on the screen.
Using Java Stream API, write queries that display the residents who find acceptable H0 and H2, and the hospitals that have R0 as their top preference.
